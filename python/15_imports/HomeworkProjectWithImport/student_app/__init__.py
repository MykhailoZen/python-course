# student_app/__init__.py

# This file can be left empty if no specific initialization is needed.
# However, you can use it to import modules for convenience:
# from . import models
# from . import routes

# Or define variables/functions accessible at the package level:
# PACKAGE_VERSION = '1.0'

# When `student_app` package is imported, these statements will be executed.
