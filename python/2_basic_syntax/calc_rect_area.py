# Create a function to find and show the area of a rectangle with known dimensions:
def calc_rect_area():
   # Define two variables, "length" and "width," and give them the values representing the rectangle's length and width:
    length = 11
    width = 8
    # Compute the area of the rectangle by multiplying the values stored in the "length" and "width" variables:
    area = length * width
    # Print the calculated area:
    print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)

# Example usage:
calc_rect_area()
