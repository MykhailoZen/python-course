# 1) Define two variables, "length" and "width," and give them the values representing the rectangle's length and width.
# 2) Compute the area of the rectangle by multiplying the values stored in the "length" and "width" variables.
# 3) Print the calculated area.

length = 35
width = 20
print('rectangle area = ' + str(length * width))
