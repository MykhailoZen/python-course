This code intentionally raises a NameError
with the message “Hi there” using the raise statement within a try block.
Then, it catches the NameError exception,
prints “An exception,” and re-raises the same exception using raise.
This demonstrates how exceptions can be raised and handled in Python,
allowing for custom error messages and further exception propagation.
