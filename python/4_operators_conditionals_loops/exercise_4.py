# Create a program that will help to find out the student's points.
# The program prompts you to enter the student's name and, if successful, returns the following message Student <name>
# has <value> points and complete its execution.
# If such a name is not in the dictionary, the program should inform about this and offer to enter another name.
# There should also be a way to end the program by typing Stop program.
