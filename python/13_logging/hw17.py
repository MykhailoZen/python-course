HOMEWORK 17



1. Add logging to the code implemented in the "Concurrency" module.

There should be at least two logging levels: debug and info.
All print statements should be replaced with logging.
Configure logging to print all log messages to the console, and write INFO+ messages to a log file.

2. Configure and run black, isort & flake8 on the files created in the "Concurrency" module.

Add ".flake8" & "pyproject.toml" files with appropriate settings.
Make sure the configurations are compatible with each other.
