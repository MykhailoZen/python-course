# 1) Create a function without arguments that outputs "Hello World!".
#
# 2) Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle.
# The function should accept the length and width of the rectangle as arguments and return the calculated area.
# Additionally, include a docstring that provides a description of what it does.
# Specific requirements for the exercise:
# Create a function named calculate_rectangle_area that takes two arguments: length and width.
# The function should return the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as multiplication of length and width.
# Include a docstring in the function that provides a description of the function's purpose.
# Test your function by calling it with various inputs and printing the results.
# Solution should include:
# The Python function calculate_rectangle_area with the required functionality and docstring.
# At least three function usage examples demonstrating the use of the function with different inputs and the expected
# output.
